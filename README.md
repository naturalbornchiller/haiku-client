# Development Process
For project 2, I placed immense primacy on form and "feel", as opposed to function. For the first day I worked on the rails api. After that though I spent the whole week working on html, css, jquery -- the interplay of each. This is my first time focusing on UX/UI, and I found it at once refreshing and maddening. There were so many tiny things—transitions, positioning, transformations, timing—that derailed me from creating 
a working MVP, and I wish I could have used my time better.

# Future Goals
I want to make the 'poems' page look extremely crisp; allow searching by title and author; create a timeline of ones own poems to view; allow for password change; restrict poem entry to haiku format. I would be happy with this.
